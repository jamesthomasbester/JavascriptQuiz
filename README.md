pretty basic as far as html and css goes, mainly focusing on the javascript side, 
only 4 questions, to make testing the functionality an easy and quick process.
documentation all in the comments of the index.js, the code gets a little messy with the highscores.

please let me know if there are some obvious ways i could refine the code.

and thanks for checking out my work!
